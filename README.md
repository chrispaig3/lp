> An embeddable plugin system for Rust applications.

- LibPlugin handles the majority of boilerplate required for implementing a functional plugin system; offering some flexibility in design & configuration.

***Still under early development; I would recommend against using it at the moment.***

    - Ron
    - Json

## Roadmap
- Improved Docs
